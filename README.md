## ‚öîÔ∏è The challenge

The challenge proposed the development of an app that let users read articles related to healthcare, using React Native.
<br>

What was requested:
- Developing three mandatory screens: Onboard, Login and Register, as close as possible to the [prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/U67le6ZsSSb0XOgU4F7COC/Est%C3%A1gio-%2F-2022.1?node-id=2%3A274)
- Get the articles from [HealthCare API](https://www.healthcare.gov/api/articles.json)
- Developing user login workflow, using functions from the loginAPI file. It is important to note that there is no back-end service and AsyncStorage was used to store the data locally.
- Use validation rules in the input fields

## üöÄ Additional functionalities

Apart from the previously said functionalities, I also added some new things:
- Search articles by language
- User logout
- Password visiblity button on inputs

## üìö Libraries

I chose to try not using a bunch of libraries, making it a simple as possible. Here are the ones I used in the project:

- React Navigation V6 ‚Üí to configure navigation.
- React Hook Form / Yup ‚Üí for validating the application input fields.
- React Native Render HTML ‚Üí as the name says, it was used to render html strings that came from the API. I chose using this library instead of React Native WebView so as to get a cleaner code, without those ugly JavaScript injections.
